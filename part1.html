            Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world,

            Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División
            that have never been relegated from the top division since its
            inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In
            2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental
            treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions
            League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six
            out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the
            Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            n 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five
            trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just
            four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport
            to be the greatest team of all time.[12][13][14] By winning their
            fifth Champions League trophy in 2015, Barcelona became the first
            European football club in history to achieve the continental treble
            twice.
